## WIO wha?
This is going to be a simple interface to the list of eligible training programs for TWC WIOA. 

The list is available on the [TWC Website as an Excel Spreadsheet](https://www.twc.texas.gov/files/partners/statewide-eligible-training-program-list-twc.xlsx) , this code just makes it searchable/filterable via a webform. 

## Roadmap 

Here's what I see as the steps to learning Laravel. 

1. Install and run Laravel Locally.
1. Change the default view to a nicer home page that explains what this project is.
1. Create model(s) in Eloquent to represent the data in the spreadsheet.
1. Import said data from spreadsheet into a database. 
1. View all records in the database. 
1. Add Pagination to the view all records.
1. Add ability to search by City
1. Add ability to search all records. 
1. Do the CRUD 
1. Import the latest version of the file from the internet. 



## Why Laravel? Why not X, or Y, or Z?
Because it's my time, and I want to learn Laravel and React/Next.js etc. I needed to reference this sheet for something else that I'm doing and I thought it would better if this sheet could be a web app of it's own, so I'm building it. 

## NoCode solutions exist for this!!
Yes, I know. I've already imported this into Airtable, but I'm over the free plan. I would need to pay $10/month, and I wouldn't have a reason to learn Laravel.
