        <h2 class="font-semibold py-2"> What is an Eligible Training Provider?</h2>
        <span class="prose">
        Eligible Training Providers (ETPs) are entities with job training programs approved by the Texas Workforce
            Commission (TWC) to provide Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA)â€“funded training services.
            Local Workforce Development Boards (Boards) fund training for Adult and Dislocated Worker program participants
            primarily through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs).
            The publicly accessible Statewide Eligible Training Providers List (ETPL) includes all programs that are currently
            approved by TWC for ITA funding.
            The Statewide ETPL Performance Report includes data related to student enrollment for approved programs
            from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2021.

Inclusion on the statewide ETPL does not guarantee that a Board will refer any student to the program or that it will receive any funds.

        <h2 class="font-semibold py-2">What is the WIOA program?</h2>
        <span class="prose">
        The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is a statute established in 2014 by the US Department of Labor (DOL).
        It enables workers to obtain good jobs by providing them with job search assistance and training opportunities.
        </span>

        <h2 class="font-semibold py-2">How does the WIOA program pay for my continuing education class?</h2>
        <span class="prose space-y-4">
        WIOA establishes a priority requirement with respect to funds allocated to a local area for adult employment and
        training activities. American Job Center staff, when using WIOA Adult funds to provide individualized career
        services and training services, must give priority to recipients of public assistance, other low-income individuals,
        and individuals who are basic skills deficient. Under WIOA, priority must be implemented regardless of the amount of
        funds available to provide services in the local area. In addition, veterans receive priority of service in all
        DOL-funded employment programs.
        </span>
        <h2 class="font-semibold py-2">Ummm... What?</h2>
        <span class="prose space-y-4">
       Basically, there's a federal program that helps people learn a new skill or trade. It's designed to
            help people in need, meaning if you're low-income, or are on welfare, and qualify, the government will pay
            for a class that will teach you a new skill, which may help you get a better job.<br />

            You need to work with your local Workforce Commission office to make sure you qualify
            and for them to pay the right people.
        </span>


        <h2 class="font-semibold py-2">I still don't understand.. how does this site help me?</h2>
        <span class="prose space-y-4">
       This website gives you the ability to search for programs that are approved by the Texas Workforce Commission.
            It tells you how much the class will cost, where it's at and who to contact to sign up for the class.
        </span>
        <h2 class="font-semibold py-2">What do I do after I sign up?</h2>
        <span class="prose space-y-4">
            Once
            you've signed up for the class, you need to contact your local TWC office, let them know you've signed up
            and want to see if you qualify for the TWC-WIOA program. The person you talk to will take it from there.
        </span>

    <h2 class="font-semibold py-2"> How do I Qualify for the TWC-WIOA program?</h2>
        <span class="prose space-y-4">
    While anyone can take these classes, not everyone will qualify for the WIOA assistance. In order to qualify you'll
    need to show you're eligible for this program. To do that you'll need to present the TWC with the following items.
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Proof of income.. or lack thereof.</li>
            <li> Past 26 weeks of paystubs (if you have any)</li>
            <li> Proof of Address </li>
            <li> You'll have to prove who's living with you/your dependents </li>
        </ul>
    </p> <br />
