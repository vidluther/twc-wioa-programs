            The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is designed to help job seekers secure the employment,
            education, training and support services necessary to succeed in the labor market and to match employers
            with the skilled workers they need to compete in the global economy.

        Every year the core programs that form the pillars of WIOA help tens of millions of job seekers and workers
            connect to good jobs and acquire the skills and credentials needed to obtain them. With the implementation
            of WIOA, the Texas workforce system will continue to be a market-driven system, responding to the needs of
            employers and preparing workers for jobs that are available now and in the future.
